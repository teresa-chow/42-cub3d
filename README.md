# Cub3D - Raycasting Engine
[![42 School: Rank 4](https://img.shields.io/badge/42%20School-Rank%204-%2315bbbb)](https://www.42network.org/)

_The goal of this project was to create a simple Wolfenstein 3D-inspired 3D game engine, using raycasting. This is done by rendering a 3D representation of a 2D map, implementing player movement, walls, textures and collision detection, while using MiniLibX graphics library._
