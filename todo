    only (no more info) -- segfault
[x] Review error messages:
    [x] "Map content misconfiguration" instead of "Map content has to be last" -- duplicate maps fall in this category
    [x] NO NO ./path/to/texture.xpm -- update error message "Spec misconfiguration", "Invalid path" instead of "Failed to open file"

validate map configuration:
  1. map section:
  [x] must be at the bottom (last piece of information)
  [x] only six possible characters*: 0 1 N S E W
  [x] *spaces are also valid: decide how to handle (accept only in boarders -- see subject example)
  [x] map must be closed: surrounded by walls (1)
  [x] map cannot contain empty new line
  [x] check edge cases and test several maps / make test maps: assets/maps/
  [x] minimal map accepted (check if there's at least the indication of the player's start position
      and if it's surrounded by walls):
        111
        1N1
        111

  2. other information:
  [x] check identifiers (any order): NO SO WE EA F C
  [x] check typos: e.g. "NOO"
  [x] check identifier config (multiple spaces accepted): NO     path/to/file
  [x] check repeated identifiers
  [x] textures: check if path/to/file exists (open)
  [x] textures: check if path/to/file is different for NO SO EA WE
  [x] textures: check file format (must be image file) .xml
  [x] colors (floor and ceiling): 3 values (R,G,B)
  [x] colors (floor and ceiling): each value between 0 and 255
  [x] fill player position t_camera struct (see comment in header file)

Rendering:
[-] raycaster
[x] arrows (left and right): change direction / rotate
[x] W A S D : change player position / move
[ ] collision detection or navigate map grid account for modulo of with and length (?)
[x] ESC / red cross button: close the window and quit program (no leaks)
[x] minimap (bonus feature)
