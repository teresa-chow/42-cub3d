Parsing:
validate map configuration:
  1. map section:
  [ ] must be at the bottom (last piece of information)
  [ ] only six possible characters*: 0 1 N S E W
  [ ] *spaces are also valid: decide how to handle (accept only in boarders -- see subject example)
  [ ] map must be closed: surrounded by walls (1)
  [ ] map cannot contain empty new line
  [ ] check edge cases and test several maps / make test maps: assets/maps/
  [ ] minimal map accepted (check if there's at least the indication of the player's start position
      and if it's surrounded by walls):
        111
        1N1
        111

  2. other information:
  [ ] check identifiers (any order): NO SO WE EA F C
  [ ] check typos: e.g. "NOO"
  [ ] check identifier config (multiple spaces accepted): NO     path/to/file
  [ ] check repeated identifiers
  [ ] textures: check if path/to/file exists (open)
  [ ] textures: check if path/to/file is different for NO SO EA WE
  [ ] textures: check file format (must be image file) .xml
  [ ] colors (floor and ceiling): 3 values (R,G,B)
  [ ] colors (floor and ceiling): each value between 0 and 255

[x] W A S D : change player position / move
[ ] collision detection or navigate map grid account for modulo of with and length (?)
[x] ESC / red cross button: close the window and quit program (no leaks)
[x] minimap (bonus feature)
